FAQ & Troubleshooting
=====================

This page collects common questions about **platform support**, **performance**,
**training stability**, and **visualization**, along with practical debugging
tips and links to further resources.

Platform Support
----------------

Does it work on macOS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, but only with limited performance. mjlab runs on macOS
using **CPU-only** execution through MuJoCo Warp.

- **Training is not recommended on macOS**, as it lacks GPU acceleration.
- **Evaluation works**, but is significantly slower than on Linux with CUDA.

For serious training workloads, we strongly recommend **Linux with an NVIDIA GPU**.

Does it work on Windows?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have performed preliminary testing on **Windows** and **WSL**, but some
workflows are not guaranteed to be stable.

- Windows support may **lag behind** Linux.
- Windows will be **tested less frequently**, since Linux is the primary
  development and deployment platform.
- Community contributions that improve Windows support are very welcome.

CUDA Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all CUDA versions are supported by MuJoCo Warp.

- See `mujoco_warp#101 <https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp/issues/101>`_
  for details on CUDA compatibility.
- **Recommended**: CUDA **12.4+** (for conditional execution support in CUDA
  graphs).

Performance
-----------

Is it faster than Isaac Lab?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on our experience over the last few months, mjlab is **on par or
faster** than Isaac Lab.

What GPU do you recommend?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **RTX 40-series GPUs** (or newer)
- **L40s, H100**

Does mjlab support multi-GPU training?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, mjlab supports **multi-GPU distributed training** using
`torchrunx <https://github.com/apoorvkh/torchrunx>`_.

- Use ``--gpu-ids "[0, 1]"`` (or ``--gpu-ids all``) when running the ``train``
  command.
- See the :doc:`training/distributed_training` for configuration details and examples.

Training & Debugging
--------------------

My training crashes with NaN errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A typical error when using ``rsl_rl`` looks like:

.. code-block:: bash

   RuntimeError: normal expects all elements of std >= 0.0

This occurs when NaN/Inf values in the **physics state** propagate to the
policy network, causing its output standard deviation to become negative or NaN.

There are many possible causes, including potential bugs in **MuJoCo Warp**
(which is still in beta). mjlab offers two complementary mechanisms to help
you handle this:

1. **For training stability** - NaN termination

Add a ``nan_detection`` termination to reset environments that hit NaN:

.. code-block:: python

   from mjlab.envs.mdp import terminations as mdp_term
   from mjlab.managers.termination_manager import TerminationTermCfg

   # In your ManagerBasedRlEnvCfg subclass:
   terminations = {
      # Your other terminations...
      "nan_term": TerminationTermCfg(func=mdp_term.nan_detection),
   }

This marks NaN environments as terminated so they can reset while training
continues. Terminations are logged as
``Episode_Termination/nan_term`` in your metrics.

.. warning::

   This is a **band-aid solution**. If NaNs correlate with your task objective
   (for example, NaNs occur exactly when the agent tries to grasp an object),
   the policy will never learn to complete that part of the task. Always
   investigate the **root cause** using ``nan_guard`` in addition to this
   termination.

2. **For debugging** - NaN guard

Enable ``nan_guard`` to capture the simulation state when NaNs occur:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run train.py --enable-nan-guard True

See the :doc:`NaN Guard documentation <debugging/nan_guard>` for details.

The ``nan_guard`` tool makes it easier to:

- Inspect the simulation state at the moment NaNs appear.
- Build a minimal reproducible example (MRE).
- Report potential framework bugs to the
  `MuJoCo Warp team <https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp/issues>`_.

Reporting well-isolated issues helps improve the framework for everyone.

How can I inspect the generated scene XML?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``export-scene`` script to write the full scene (XML and mesh assets)
to a directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    uv run export-scene g1 --output-dir /tmp/g1

The exported ``scene.xml`` can be loaded directly in MuJoCo for visual
inspection or diffing. This is useful for verifying that task configuration
and physics are set up correctly, and for creating minimal reproducible
examples to share with mjlab or MuJoCo Warp developers. The script accepts task IDs,
entity aliases (``g1``, ``go1``, ``yam``), or arbitrary import paths. See
:doc:`debugging/export_scene` for full details.

My contact sensor misses collisions when using decimation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ``decimation > 1`` the physics runs multiple substeps per policy
step. A brief contact (e.g. a self collision or an illegal ground touch)
can appear and disappear within the substep loop, so by the time the
sensor is read, ``found`` is zero and the event is invisible to
rewards and terminations.

Set ``history_length`` on the ``ContactSensorCfg`` equal to your
decimation value. The sensor then stores force, torque, and distance
for the last *N* substeps. Your reward or termination function can
inspect the history to detect contacts that would otherwise be missed:

.. code-block:: python

    ContactSensorCfg(
        name="self_collision",
        ...,
        fields=("found", "force"),
        history_length=4,  # matches decimation=4
    )

    # In the reward/termination function:
    force_mag = torch.norm(sensor.data.force_history, dim=-1)  # [B, N, H]
    had_contact = (force_mag > 10.0).any(dim=1).any(dim=-1)    # [B]

See :ref:`contact-sensor-history` for full details.

.. note::

   Feet ground sensors with ``track_air_time=True`` already accumulate
   contact state across substeps, so they do not need history.

.. _faq-sim-forward:

When do I need to call ``sim.forward()``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Short answer: you almost certainly don't.

``sim.forward()`` wraps MuJoCo's ``mj_forward``, which runs the full forward
dynamics pipeline (kinematics, contacts, forces, constraint solving, sensors)
but skips integration, leaving ``qpos``/``qvel`` unchanged. It brings all
derived quantities in ``mjData`` (``xpos``, ``xquat``, ``site_xpos``,
``cvel``, ``sensordata``, etc.) into a consistent state with the current
``qpos``/``qvel``.
The environment's ``step()`` method calls it once per step, right before
observation computation, so observations, commands, and interval events
always see fresh derived quantities. Termination and reward managers run
*before* this call and therefore see derived quantities that are stale by
one physics substep, a deliberate tradeoff that avoids a second
``forward()`` call while keeping the MDP well-defined (the staleness is
consistent across all envs and all steps).

The one case where this matters is if you write an event or command that
both writes state and reads derived quantities in the same function. For
example, if Event A calls ``entity.write_root_velocity_to_sim()`` (which
modifies ``qvel``) and then immediately reads ``entity.data.root_link_vel_w``
(which comes from ``cvel``), the read will see stale values from before the
write.

.. warning::

   Write methods (``write_root_state_to_sim``, ``write_joint_state_to_sim``,
   etc.) modify ``qpos``/``qvel`` directly. Read properties
   (``root_link_pose_w``, ``body_link_vel_w``, etc.) return derived
   quantities that are only current as of the last ``sim.forward()`` call.
   If you need to write then read in the same function, call
   ``env.sim.forward()`` between them.

For a deeper explanation, see `Discussion #289
<https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/discussions/289>`_.

Why aren't my training runs reproducible even with a fixed seed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MuJoCo Warp does not yet guarantee determinism, so running the same
simulation with identical inputs may produce slightly different outputs.
This is a known limitation being tracked in
`mujoco_warp#562 <https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp/issues/562>`_.

Until determinism is implemented upstream, mjlab training runs will not be
perfectly reproducible even when setting a seed.

Rendering & Visualization
-------------------------

What visualization options are available?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mjlab currently supports two visualizers for policy evaluation and
debugging:

- **Native MuJoCo visualizer** - the built-in visualizer that ships with MuJoCo.
- **Viser** - `Viser <https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/viser>`_,
  a web-based 3D visualization tool.

We are exploring **training-time visualization** (e.g., live rollout viewers),
but this is not yet available.

As an alternative, mjlab supports **video logging to Weights & Biases
(W&B)**, so you can monitor rollout videos directly in the experiment dashboard.

How many environments can I visualize at once?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Viewers render a small number of environments for performance reasons.

- **Offscreen renderer** (for video recording): Renders the tracked
  environment plus its nearest neighbors. The count is controlled by
  ``ViewerConfig.max_extra_envs`` (default 2).
- **Native/Viser viewers**: Limited by MuJoCo's geometry buffer
  (default 10,000 geoms). The viewer shows whichever environments fit
  within the geometry budget.

Why are my fixed-base robots all stacked at the origin instead of in a grid?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed-base robots require an **explicit reset event** to position them at
their ``env_origins``. If your robots appear stacked at (0, 0, 0):

**Common causes:**

1. **Missing reset event** - Most common issue.
2. **env_spacing is 0 or very small** - Check your ``SceneCfg(env_spacing=...)``.
   Even with proper reset events, if ``env_spacing=0.0``, all robots will
   be at the same position. If ``env_spacing`` is very small (e.g., 0.01),
   they'll be clustered in a tiny area that looks like a line from a distance.

**Solution**: Add a reset event that calls ``reset_root_state_uniform``:

.. code-block:: python

   # In your ManagerBasedRlEnvCfg
   events = {
     # For positioning the base of the robot at env_origins.
     "reset_base": EventTermCfg(
       func=mdp.reset_root_state_uniform,
       mode="reset",
       params={
         "pose_range": {},  # Empty = use default pose + env_origins
         "velocity_range": {},
       },
     ),
     # ... other events
   }

This pattern is used in the example manipulation task (see ``lift_cube_env_cfg.py:85-94``).

**Why this is needed**: Fixed-base robots are automatically wrapped in mocap
bodies by ``auto_wrap_fixed_base_mocap()``, but mocap positioning only happens
when you explicitly call a reset event. The ``env_origins`` offset is applied
inside ``reset_root_state_uniform()`` at line 131 of ``envs/mdp/events.py``.

See `issue #560 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/issues/560>`_ for examples.

How does env_origins determine robot layout?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot spacing depends on your terrain configuration:

**Plane terrain** (``terrain_type="plane"``):
  - Creates an approximately square grid automatically
  - Grid size: ``ceil(sqrt(num_envs))`` rows x cols
  - Spacing controlled by ``env_spacing`` parameter (default: 2.0m)
  - Examples with ``env_spacing=2.0``:
    - 32 envs → 7x5 grid spanning 12m x 8m
    - 4096 envs → 64x64 grid spanning 126m x 126m
  - **Important**: If ``env_spacing=0``, all robots will be at (0, 0, 0)
  - Implementation: ``terrain_importer.py:_compute_env_origins_grid()``

**Procedural terrain** (``terrain_type="generator"``):
  - Origins loaded from pre-generated terrain sub-patches
  - Grid size: ``TerrainGeneratorCfg.num_rows x num_cols``
  - Row index = difficulty level (curriculum mode)
  - Column index = terrain type variant
  - **Important allocation behavior**: Columns (terrain types) are evenly distributed
    across environments, but rows (difficulty levels) are randomly sampled. This means
    multiple environments can spawn on the same (row, col) patch, leaving others unoccupied,
    even when ``num_envs > num_patches``.
  - Example: 5x5 grid (25 patches), 100 envs → each column gets exactly 20 envs,
    but those 20 are randomly distributed across 5 rows, so some patches remain empty.
  - Supports ``randomize_env_origins()`` to shuffle positions during training

How do I ensure each terrain type gets its own column?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set ``curriculum=True`` in your ``TerrainGeneratorCfg``. This makes column
allocation deterministic, with each column getting one terrain type based on
normalized proportions.

Example with 2 terrain types:

.. code-block:: python

   TerrainGeneratorCfg(
     num_rows=3,
     num_cols=2,
     curriculum=True,  # Required for deterministic column allocation!
     sub_terrains={
       "flat": BoxFlatTerrainCfg(proportion=0.5),  # Gets column 0
       "pillars": HfDiscreteObstaclesTerrainCfg(
         proportion=0.5,  # Gets column 1
       ),
     },
   )

Without ``curriculum=True``, every patch is randomly sampled and you'll get
a random mix of both terrain types scattered across all patches.

**Note**: When ``num_cols`` equals the number of terrain types, each terrain
gets exactly one column regardless of proportion values (they're normalized).
When ``num_cols > num_terrain_types``, proportions determine how many columns
each terrain type occupies.

What is flat patch sampling and how does it affect robot spawning?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flat patch sampling detects flat regions on heightfield terrains where robots
can safely spawn. It uses morphological filtering on the heightfield to find
circular areas where height variation is within a tolerance.

Configure it on any sub-terrain via ``flat_patch_sampling``:

.. code-block:: python

   from mjlab.terrains.terrain_generator import FlatPatchSamplingCfg

   "obstacles": HfDiscreteObstaclesTerrainCfg(
     ...,
     flat_patch_sampling={
       "spawn": FlatPatchSamplingCfg(
         num_patches=10,      # patches to sample per sub-terrain
         patch_radius=0.5,    # flatness check radius (meters)
         max_height_diff=0.05,  # max height variation within radius
       ),
     },
   )

Then use ``reset_root_state_from_flat_patches`` as your reset event to spawn
robots on detected patches instead of at the sub-terrain center.

**Key details:**

- Only heightfield (``Hf*``) terrains support actual flat patch detection.
  Box terrains (``Box*``) don't have heightfield data to analyze.
- If any sub-terrain in the grid configures ``flat_patch_sampling``, the
  flat patches array is allocated for **all** cells. Sub-terrains that don't
  produce patches have their slots filled with the sub-terrain's spawn origin,
  so ``reset_root_state_from_flat_patches`` always gets valid positions.
- Without ``flat_patch_sampling``, use ``reset_root_state_uniform`` which
  spawns at the sub-terrain origin (``env_origins``) plus an optional random
  offset.

Development & Extensions
------------------------

Can I develop custom tasks in my own repository?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, mjlab has a **plugin system** that lets you develop tasks in separate
repositories while still integrating seamlessly with the core:

- Your tasks appear as regular entries for the ``train`` and ``play`` commands.
- You can version and maintain your task repositories independently.

A complete guide will be available in a future release.

Assets & Compatibility
----------------------

What robots are included?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mjlab includes two **reference robots**:

- **Unitree Go1** (quadruped).
- **Unitree G1** (humanoid).

These robots serve as:

- Minimal examples for **robot integration**.
- Stable, well-tested baselines for **benchmark tasks**.

To keep the core library lean, we do **not** plan to aggressively expand the
built-in robot library. Additional robots may be provided in separate
repositories or community-maintained packages.

Can I use USD or URDF models?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, mjlab expects **MJCF (MuJoCo XML)** models.

- You will need to **convert** USD or URDF assets to MJCF.
- For many common robots, you can directly use
  `MuJoCo Menagerie <https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie>`_,
  which ships high-quality MJCF models and assets.
